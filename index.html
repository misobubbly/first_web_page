    <h1>Kona's World</h1>

    <p>
      Meet Kona, a curious and playful Coton de Tuléar, born on 23 June, 2017. He began his journey to his forever home on a United Airlines flight bound for Portland, Oregon on 31 August 2017, and met his pawrents for the first time in the wee hours of the following day. He was only 4 lbs! While a little unsure about his new surroundings, he was as adorable and as lovable as can be. He quickly settled in to his new home and is now a <em><b>**whopping 13 lbs**</b></em> and known around the house as King Kona.

      In case you’re wondering, as many people that meet Kona do, <em>Coton</em> just means cotton in French and describes the cotton-like coat that the small dog breed is famous for. And <em>de Tuelar</em> means “of the city of Tuléar”. Cotons are also known as the Royal Dog of Madagascar.

      When Kona isn’t out exploring the world, he’s playing at home with his favourite toys and taking lots of puppy naps in his favourite position: the sploot. He has this wonderful jois de vivre and makes the perfect anti-depressant for those that are prone to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20364651">S.A.D.</a> Kona's always up for a good time and enjoys a good curry every now and then.
